## Version 1.0.1
```
In the first version the menu does not work due to programming errors _(my fault)_, they are already corrected and the code is functional.
```
* Fixed bugs that prevented the in-game menu from being displayed
* The option that allows to show and its respective time is added
* The option to exit in an optimal way is added according to the documentation.
* Added a README.md on Github

## Developer instructions
